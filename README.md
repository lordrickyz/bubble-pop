## Background:

Bubble Pop is a clone of a popular 1994 tile-matching arcade puzzle game called [Puzzle Bobble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble). 

At the start of each round, the gamespace will contain prearranged patterns of colored bubbles or balls. At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a "pointer", which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The color of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen. The objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line.
